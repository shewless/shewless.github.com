It appears the default *comments* option for [Octopress](http://www.octopress.org) is *true* but you will notice that a default Octopress blog does not actually have a comment section.

This is because you need to configure a **[Disqus](http://disqus.com/)** account first.

1. Register your webiste here: [http://disqus.com/admin/register/](http://disqus.com/admin/register/)
